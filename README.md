# genetic-algos
A ground-up implementation of a genetic algorithm on Python, for future use in a QAOA-type quantum algorithm and optimized adiabatic evolution for general purposes. 

In the bitwise_genetic notebook, you can have fun implementing a bit-wise genetic algorithm to find the minimum of a D-dimensional function. You can feed a N bit string, which will be compiled into a custom float-N (base 2). GO and play around with it!

In genetic_adiabatic_dwave, you can use another genetic algorithm version to optimize the annealing path for a complicated spin glass problem. The goal there is to obtain a good solution faster than with the simple, linear annealing path.
